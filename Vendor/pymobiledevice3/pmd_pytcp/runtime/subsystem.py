    Base class for stack-internal background runtime components.
    Each subclass implements the coroutine '_subsystem_loop()'
    which the base wraps in a 'while not stop_event' loop running
    on an 'asyncio.Task' created by 'start()' and cancelled by
    'stop()'. Used by the DHCP clients and 'NeighborCache' (the
    IPv4 'ArpCache' and IPv6 'NdCache' parents) — every long-lived
    kernel-side runtime that needs an independent flow of control
    on the stack's event loop. (See
    'docs/refactor/pure_asyncio.md' — the whole stack runs on ONE
    event loop; there are no threads.)

    This is a runtime / kernel-side primitive, NOT a Phase-3
    public API surface. Userspace consumers MUST NOT
    subclass it — see CLAUDE.md "no userspace reach-through
    to stack internals". The home in 'pmd_pytcp/runtime/' is
    structurally enforcing that boundary.

    Initialisation contract — subclasses must set
    'self._subsystem_name' BEFORE calling 'super().__init__()'
    because the base init logs an 'Initializing <name>' line
    on the 'stack' channel.
